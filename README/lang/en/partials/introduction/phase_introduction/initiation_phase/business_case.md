#### We want to manage and fund and market the development of AEOLUM by using web3 technologies.

We see NFTs as both a funding and an access mechanism to our marketing material experience. A user or client can receive our design products directly without contribution to our funding. In the mean time we attempt to create a immersive experience for the ones who do participate in funding our Typography Department (TYDE). The 3D experience is accessible via [NFT Proof of Balance](https://github.com/VivaRado/NFT-Proof-of-Balance) by purchasing [$AEO](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xfd7ca4289770fba797957e37be66912fadce5d56).
