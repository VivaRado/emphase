The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

We work around the product to achieve a smooth integration of all the parts, we have created [SYFF](https://github.com/VivaRado/SYFF) to help with combining letterforms in a distributed fashion that allows editability from files that look like CSS, we started developing the ThreeJS experience, the progress of which is on our [AEOLUM OpenSea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/aeolum), and we have managed to use [NFT Proof of Balance](https://github.com/VivaRado/NFT-Proof-of-Balance) as an access mechanism for said experience website. We think this will be a worth while journey for all of you who agree that this is a valid way to market, fund, develop type and type as art in line with web3 principles laid out in our [Digital Transformation booklet](https://opensea.io/collection/vrd) you can check that out on our [website](https://vivarado.com/api/metaverse?pack=en).
